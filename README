Project Description
========
A library for comparing two HTML files/snippets and highlighting the differences using simple HTML.


This HTML Diff implementation is a C# port of the ruby implementation found here: https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff

Usage
========

I have put together a blog post covering how to use the library here (http://www.rohland.co.za/index.php/2009/10/31/csharp-html-diff-algorithm/). Also, a demo web application project is provided with the solution.
